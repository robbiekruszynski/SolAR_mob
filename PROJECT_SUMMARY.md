- **AR camera integration** for treasure scanning
- **GPS location tracking** for treasure discovery
- **Real-time wallet connection** via Solana Mobile Stack

### Backend (Solana Blockchain)
- **Smart contracts** built with Anchor Framework
- **NFT minting** with metadata support
- **BONK token integration** for rewards
- **Location-based treasure verification**

### Key Features

#### 🗺️ AR Treasure Hunting
- Real-time camera scanning for treasure markers
- GPS-based location verification
- 3D AR overlays for treasure visualization
- QR code scanning for treasure activation

#### 💰 Solana Integration

- NFT minting on treasure discovery
- BONK token rewards for successful hunts
- Transaction history and balance tracking

#### 🎮 Gamification
- Treasure map with nearby locations
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Leaderboard system (planned)
- Achievement system (planned)

## 📱 Mobile Features

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **iOS**: ARKit integration for advanced AR
- **Android**: ARCore support for AR functionality
- **Offline support** for basic functionality
- **Push notifications** for treasure alerts

### Performance Optimizations
- Hermes JavaScript engine
- Optimized bundle size
- Efficient state management
- Background location tracking

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Smart Contracts (`contracts/`)
```rust
// Main treasure hunt contract
pub mod treasure_hunt {
    // Initialize treasure with location and rewards
    pub fn initialize_treasure(...) -> Result<()>
    
    // Discover treasure and mint NFT
    pub fn discover_treasure(...) -> Result<()>
}
```

### Mobile Adapter (`mobile-adapter/`)
```typescript
// Wallet connection and transaction signing
export class MobileWalletAdapter {
    async connect(): Promise<PublicKey>
    async signTransaction(transaction: Transaction): Promise<Transaction>
}

// BONK token integration
export class BonkIntegration {
    async getBonkBalance(): Promise<number>
    async transferBonk(to: PublicKey, amount: number): Promise<string>
}
```

### App Screens
1. **Home Screen**: Welcome, stats, quick actions
2. **AR Scanner**: Camera-based treasure detection
3. **Treasure Map**: Location-based treasure discovery
4. **Wallet**: Solana wallet management and BONK balance
